# NLP
## What is it?
In this NLP project, I explored Brown text corpus from NLTK package, processed the text 
and applied NLP operations such as stemming, lemmatization, finding synonyms and antonyms, and finding bigrams.

In addition, visualization (bar plot & heatmap) is used to present the derived results. 

## Figures

Figures below are some of the visualization:
